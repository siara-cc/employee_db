# Sqlite3 port of mysql test_db

This project hosts the Sqlite3 db file ported from mysql test_db found at https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db.  To use this project, download employees.db.bz2, unzip and open using sqlite3 command line tool.

Minor changes have been made to the schema per suggestions from people of `sqlite-users` group.

Given below Schema section is the README from the other repository, with the usage part removed.  This project is also hosted under the same license (CC-BY-SA-3.0).

# test_db

A sample database with an integrated test suite, used to test your applications and database servers

This repository was migrated from [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/test-db).

## Where it comes from

The original data was created by Fusheng Wang and Carlo Zaniolo at 
Siemens Corporate Research. The data is in XML format.
http://timecenter.cs.aau.dk/software.htm

Giuseppe Maxia made the relational schema and Patrick Crews exported
the data in relational format.

The database contains about 300,000 employee records with 2.8 million 
salary entries. The export data is 167 MB, which is not huge, but
heavy enough to be non-trivial for testing.

The data was generated, and as such there are inconsistencies and subtle
problems. Rather than removing them, we decided to leave the contents
untouched, and use these issues as data cleaning exercises.

## DISCLAIMER

To the best of my knowledge, this data is fabricated and
it does not correspond to real people. 
Any similarity to existing people is purely coincidental.
